## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("~/Desktop/CorporateFinance404/hw2/sp500.csv")
df = df.replace('C',0)
dividend_date = df.dropna().index.values
dividends = len(dividend_date)
non_dividend = list()
for i in range(-20,21):
    x = [j + i for j in dividend_date]
    non_dividend.append(x)

return_mean = list()
for i in non_dividend:
    temp = df.iloc[i,3].astype('float').subtract(df.iloc[i,4])
    return_mean.append(np.mean(temp))
plt.plot([i for i in range(-20,21)],return_mean)
plt.ylabel("Excess Return")
plt.xlabel("Days related to dividend date")
plt.show()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
