# Problem Set 1 Solution Template
# mysoln is a list to store your answers

# the first element of the list is a vector of names for the students in your group
# make sure these match the names shown on the pdf document provided by the MFE office
# using group 1 as an example:
mysoln <- list(student = c("Molin Liang", "Meghana Rao", "Chengbo Du", "Shardul Kulkarni"))
